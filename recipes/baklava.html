    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Baklava is a delicious Greek dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, honey and nuts that's sooo easy to make. A Greek friend showed me how to make this fabulous recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
        <li>Mixture of any assortment of nuts</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. 
            Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. 
            Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</li>
         <li>
            Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.
         </li>
         <li>
            Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving.
